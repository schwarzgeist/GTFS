# GTFS #
Used to mostly store GTFS-Realtime Stuff that may be useful to someone.

## C++ ##
Right now, just has a parser for reading in a file that's of the binary GTFS-Realtime format.
I absolutely could not find any implementation online that did this, so I'm uploading what I have in case its useful.

If you do find it useful, give me a shoutout if you'd like.
