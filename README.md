# GTFS #
Used to mostly store GTFS-Realtime Stuff that will hopefully be useful to someone.

## C++ ##
Right now, just has a parser for reading in a file that's of the binary GTFS-Realtime format.
I absolutely could not find any implementation online that did this, so I'm uploading what I have in case its useful.

## SQL ##
This mostly contains just some helpful information to get the data you need from GTFS files.
